# Security Policy

We appreciate responsible disclosures that help keep the Lattice Simulator and
the wider GridPlus ecosystem safe. Please follow the guidelines below when
reporting security issues.

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are applied to the `main` branch and the latest tagged release.
Older releases may not be patched retroactively.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

1. **Do not** open a public GitHub issue for security reports.
2. Email a detailed report (steps to reproduce, impact, affected components, and
   suggested mitigations if known) to
   [security@gridplus.io](mailto:security@gridplus.io).
3. Encrypt sensitive details if needed; we can coordinate PGP keys after initial
   contact.

We aim to acknowledge new reports within 3 business days. Please allow adequate
time for investigation and remediation before any public disclosure.

## Responsible Disclosure

- Give the maintainers a reasonable window to fix the issue before sharing it
  publicly.
- Avoid exploiting the vulnerability beyond what’s necessary to demonstrate the
  impact.
- Once a fix is released, we’ll work with you on coordinated disclosure and
  attribution (if desired).

Thank you for helping us keep the simulator secure.
